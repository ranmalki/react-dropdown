# React Dropdown Exercise

### Goal: Make a dropdown menu.

### Spec:
- On click, it should open the dropdown menu
- Second click should close it
- **Bonus - Optional only:** Clicking outside of the button, should also close it

### Expected result:

### Guidelines:
1. Make it look as close as possible to the expected result.
   
2. You need to have 4 components:
- `Dropdown` - Wraps everything
- `DropdownButton` - The button that opens/closes the dropdown menu
- `DropdownMenu` - The white box that opens when clicking `DropdownButton`
- `DropdownItem` - An item in the `DropdownMenu`

3. Make it generic! The user might want to have several dropdown across his app.
Take in consideration that every dropdown may contain different items.
